## Install CF CLI

You will be using the Cloud Foundry CLI to interact with the runtime once it has been provisioned. Unlike the commercial distribution of Pivotal Cloud Foundry bosh-lite does not have an Applications Dashboard and all inspection and interaction with the Cloud Foundry runtime needs to be done through the CLI.

* Download

	```
	curl -L https://cli.run.pivotal.io/stable?release=debian64&source=github -o cf-cli-installer_6.14.0_x86-64.deb
	```

	> If curl command fails in you environment download using a browser

* Install

	```
	sudo dpkg -i cf-cli-installer_6.14.0_x86-64.deb
	```

* Verify

	```
	cf help
	```

## Install Ruby

Tthe Bosh CLI is based on Ruby. So you need to ensure Ruby is installed in your system to be able to provision Cloud Foundry to the Bosh-Lite VM. The Cloud Foundry CLI does is based on GO so it does not require the Ruby runtime.

### Using a Ruby Version Manager

* Install [Ruby Version Manager](http://rvm.io/).

	```
	gpg --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3
	\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
	```

	> If the above commands fail then follow the instructions on the RVM web site for 	alternate installation methods.

* Install Ruby

	```
	rvm install ruby-2.2
	rvm --default use 2.2
	source ~/.bashrc
	```

* Verify 

	```
	ruby -v
	```

### Install to your system ruby

Alternatively install ruby via apt-get. Not that if you install the system ruby you will have to provision as sudo. 

```
sudo apt-get install ruby
```

> Installing a system Ruby is not recommended as undoing issues that may arise from mismatched gems are difficult and the need to run ruby commands as sudo.

### Install [Vagrant](https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/)

The Bosh-Lite VM will be deployed to a Virtual Box hypervisor using Vagrant. Vagrant provides a convenient CLI to launch VMs using a configuration file. It needs to be invoked from a folder that contains a `VagrantFile` in order for a VM to be deployed. This file contains information such as the VM image, cpus, memory, network etc.

* Verify [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) is installed


	```
	VBoxManage --version
	```

* Download

	```
	curl -OL https://releases.hashicorp.com/vagrant/1.7.4/vagrant_1.7.4_x86_64.deb
	```

* Install

	```
	sudo dpkg -i vagrant_1.7.4_x86_64.deb
	```

* Verify

	```
	vagrant -v
	```

### Install [Bosh Lite](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-lite)

* Clone repo

	```
	git clone https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-lite
	```

* Start Bosh VM

	```
	cd bosh-lite
	vagrant up
	```

$ Install bosh-cli

	```
	gem install bosh_cli --no-document
	```

* Verify Bosh

	```
	bosh target 192.168.50.4 lite
	bosh login admin admin
	bosh deployments
	```

* If you installed a system ruby then ensure bundler is installed

	```
	sudo gem install bundler --no-document
	```

* Download [spiff](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/spiff)

	```
	curl -OL https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/spiff/releases/download/v1.0.7/spiff_linux_amd64.zip
	```

Once downloaded unzip it and copy the `spiff` binary to the `/usr/bin` folder.

* Provision Cloud Foundry

	```
	./bin/add-route
	./bin/provision_cf
	```

	> Run the provision script as sudo if you are using the system Ruby.

* Verify Cloud Foundry by loging in and creating your first org and space

	```
	cf login --skip-ssl-validation -a https://api.bosh-lite.com -u admin -p admin
	cf create-org pcf-training
	cf create-space development -o pcf-training
	```

### Troubleshooting bosh-lite

* Before you shutdown your system make sure you suspend the bosh-lite VM.

	```
	vagrant suspend
	```

* Once you have restarted you workstation then resume the bosh-lite VM.

	```
	vagrant up
	```

* Sometimes your bosh agents may become unresponsive and although your VM comes up you will not be able to access your Cloud Foundry deployment. To recover.

	```
	bosh cck
	```

* Instruct bosh to re-create the managed VMs when it gives you the recovery options. Once recovery is complete ensure the route to the warden containers within the bosh-lite VMs is re-established.

	```
	./bin/add-route
	```

	> If bosh appears to be running and you are still unable to connect then run `add-route`.

### Cloud lab files

* Pivotal Cloud Foundry Labs

	```
	cd ~
	git clone https://github.com/S2EDU/CloudFoundryStudentFiles
	```

* Spring Boot Labs

	```
	cd ~
	git clone https://github.com/pivotal-enablement/spring-boot-labs
	git clone https://github.com/pivotal-enablement/spring-cloud-services-labs
	```
